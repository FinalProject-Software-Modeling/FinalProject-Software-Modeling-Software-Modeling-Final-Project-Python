# FinalProject-Software-Modeling-Software-Modeling-Final-Project-Python
This repository contains the development of the virtual wallet project using the concept of object-oriented programming and software design patterns.
In this way, we have a Documentation folder which includes the technical report of the application, as well as the paper and poster of the project.
On the other hand, we have a folder called src which contains the code implementation of the application.
The user stories created as the foundation of the virtual wallet are the following:


UH_1: As CTO, I want to keep a record of the users who enter the application. I want to
know their first and last name, cell phone number, email address, and ID, to know who
is using our service.

UH_2: As CTO I want to offer a simple way for users to access their digital wallet, so that

everyone can access the service easily and immediately.
UH_3: As CTO I want to be able to send money between different wallets so that users
can make fast and secure transfers within the ecosystem.

UH_4: As CTO I want users to be able to link a debit card to their wallet so they can
make payments easily.

UH_5: As a user, I want to be able to withdraw money from my wallet at a physical
location so that I can access my cash quickly and conveniently when I need it.

UH_6: As a user, I want to be able to load money into my account in different ways so
that I can have flexibility and ease when adding funds.

UH_7: As a user, I want to be able to request money from a friend who also has the app
so that I can receive the money quickly and easily without complications.

UH_8: As a user, I want to be able to see how much money I currently have and a history
of all the transactions made so that I can keep track and monitor my finances.

UH_9: As CTO, I want to know the user's place of residence and their ID to ensure that
all legal requirements are met.
